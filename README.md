# DeepLearning_Project
This is a Deep learning project done by me for the Deep Learning module offered by the University of Leeds.
The Projects contains making DNN, CNN models along with concepts like Tranfer Learning, image augmentation, hyper parameter tuning etc.
The is also a RNN part involved, generating captions for images (Pretrained network used)
